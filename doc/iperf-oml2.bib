    abstract = {The OMF Measurement Library (OML) is an instrumentation system which enables an experimenter to process any type of measurements from distributed applications and collect them in a unified way. We present a comprehensive study of the performance of this library. The analysis focuses on the behaviour, accuracy and precision of instrumented applications, as well as the background footprint such as CPU load and memory usage. To this end, we have modified typical network measurement tools (Iperf) and libraries (libtrace, libsigar) to use OML as their reporting channel. Following extensive experiments, we find little or no negative impact of OML when comparing the OML-enhanced tools to their original versions. Moreover, in the case of Iperf, when we find significant differences, they are positive, with improvements in the accuracy of both the network probing and jitter measurements. We discuss the implications of using OML in the context of experiment-based networking research and give recommendations on its use and the analysis of the produced results.},
